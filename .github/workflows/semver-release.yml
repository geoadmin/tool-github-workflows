name: SemVer Release Reusable Workflow

# Tag repository using SemVer. Merging in develop tagged the repo with beta version.
# Merging to master tag with release and create a release with release notes based
# on the PR titles. The minor version is bumped by default in the master branch.
# To bump the major or patch version when merging to master, add #major or #patch
# in the PR title.

# Usage example
# on:
#   push:
#     branches:
#       - master
#       - develop

# jobs:
#   release:
#     uses: geoadmin/.github/.github/workflows/semver.yml@master
